    <!-- Task1: Implement a custom DOM event delegation system for multiple buttons dynamically added after page load. -->
    

    <!-- Event Delegation: Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to manage events for its child elements. This approach leverages the concept of event bubbling, where events triggered on a child element propagate upwards through the DOM tree to its parent elements and parent handle that event by single event handler -->
