      //Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

  
      // In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
      x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

      elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element

      var x; // Declare x

      //example2
      var x; // Declare x
      x = 6; // Assign 5 to x

      elem = document.getElementById("demo1"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element

//       Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared

// Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.

// JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

var x = 5;  // Initialize x

elem = document.getElementById("demo3");      // Find an element 
elem.innerHTML = "x is " + x + " and y is " + y;  // Display x and y

var y = 7;  // Initialize y


// JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.
    
 // The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript refers to a period of time during which variables declared with let or const exist within a scope but cannot be accessed or assigned a value. Any attempt to access these variables within their TDZ will result in a ReferenceError.
